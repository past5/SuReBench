0,Salesforce/InstruSum,64,Personal Attacks/Mockery/Dismissive Statements,"One of the UK's most successful songwriters, Take that frontman Gary Barlow has become an OBE in the Queen's birthday honours list. Singer, songwriter and fundraiser are just some of the caps worn by Gary Barlow who has been made an OBE in the Queen's birthday honours list. The 41-year-old father of four's career began more than 20 years ago, playing the northern club circuit as a solo singer for less than £20 a show. He would go on to find worldwide success with Take That, one of Britain's biggest and most successful pop groups. As well as writing 11 UK number one singles over the past three decades, Barlow has had three solo chart topping singles and two number one albums. In recent years, he has become increasingly known for his charity work and TV projects including judging on The X Factor and organising the Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert. In a statement, Barlow said: ""I'm absolutely thrilled and feel very privileged to be in the company of so many brilliant people who I know have received an OBE. ""Growing up I never dreamt that one day I'd be getting one myself. ""I enjoy every minute of the work I do, with a lot of it being a reward in itself, so for somebody to decide I should get recognised for that is just amazing. My family are very proud."" Early Career As a member of the pop sensation Take That, Barlow wrote most of the group's songs including Pray, their first number one UK single. The song also won Barlow an Ivor Novello for Best Contemporary Song in 1994. His 1995 song Back For Good, topped the chart in more than 30 countries and is considered one of the most successful songs ever released by a boyband. In his 2006 autobiography, Gary Barlow recounted that his love of music began at an early age. ""I was one of those kids that's forever dancing in front of the TV looking at my reflection."" When Take That split in 1996, Barlow enjoyed solo success with his debut album Open Road. However, his follow-up Twelve Months, Eleven Days did not fare as well. With little airplay or promotion, it limped into the chart at number 35 and fell out of the top 100 the following week. So began the next stage of Barlow's career - returning to his roots as a songwriter. A six-time recipient of a prestigious Ivor Novello award, Barlow has written with the likes of Charlotte Church, Lily Allen, Sir Elton John and Dame Shirley Bassey. In 2006, Take That, minus Robbie Williams, reformed for a sell out stadium tour and enjoyed a career renaissance with a string of number one songs, starting with the single Patience. Beautiful World, the band's first album in over ten years has since sold nearly three million copies in the UK alone. Two more albums and tours have since followed, Take That's Progress Live in 2011 set box office records for ticket sales, seeing them play to 1.8 million fans over 29 shows in the UK. Barlow married Dawn Andrews in 2000. She was a dancer on the band's Nobody Else Tour in 1995. The couple have four children, their youngest daughter was born earlier this year. In 2010, Barlow became a judge on ITV's X Factor. Speaking last year about his return to the show for a second series, Barlow said in a statement: ""I'm thrilled to be back and really looking forward to working with The X Factor team again."" Charity work Barlow has organised and been involved in numerous fundraising projects for a host of different charities. In 2009 he was joined by eight other celebrities including Cheryl Cole and Ronan Keating in a sponsored climb to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro. The group safely reached the summit, raising millions of pounds for Comic Relief. He was later awarded the prestigious Blue Peter Gold Badge for outstanding achievements and inspiring children to realise their talents. In response to the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, Barlow recorded Everybody Hurts along with some of the world's most famous music stars with all proceeds of the single going to the cause. The song sold 453,000 copies in its first week, making it the fastest-selling charity record of the 21st Century in Britain. Later that year, Barlow and former Take That band mate Robbie Williams performed live together for the first time in 15 years. They performed the song, Shame, with proceeds going to the Help For Heroes charity, which raises funds for wounded troops and their families. The singer continued his fundraising efforts when he took to the stage in December 2011 for two solo gigs - his first in more than 10 years. The concerts took place at London's Royal Albert Hall on 5 and 6 December, and raised money for the Prince's Trust and The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry. Barlow said after the show: ""It's been great. Both nights were amazing; people have been buying lots of merchandise which all goes to a good cause."" He also helped to organise the Children In Need Rocks gig in Manchester at the end of 2011, where he performed alongside Lady Gaga and Coldplay. Perhaps his most momentous work to date has been his involvement in the Queen's recent 86th birthday and Diamond Jubilee celebrations. As the lead organiser, he produced a jubilee album and concert outside Buckingham Palace on 4 June, which featured renowned artists such as Sir Paul McCartney, Sir Elton John and Kylie Minogue. The concert included music spanning every decade of the Queen's reign. Barlow appeared alongside Andrew Lloyd Webber and his own Commonwealth Band to perform the official jubilee single, Sing, which they wrote together. The track features 210 musicians including the African Children's Choir, Aboriginal guitarist Gurrumul, Slum Drummers from Kenya's Kibera slum and the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force Band. Sing was released as the lead single from the album of the same name, which is raising money for the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust. Other tracks on the album feature singers including Hayley Westenra, Alfie Boe and Laura Wright. Entering the UK Album Chart at number 1, it is Barlow's second solo number 1 album and his first in 15 years. Commenting on its success, Barlow said: ""I couldn't have wished for anything more on this momentous weekend.""","One of the UK's most successful songwriters, Take that frontman Gary Barlow has become an OBE in the Queen's birthday honours list.

1,Salesforce/InstruSum,81,Hate/Threats/Intimidation,"The complex web of paramilitary gangs, security and intelligence forces, agents and informers, in Northern Ireland during the years of conflict were not a consideration for dictionary compilers when they wrote the entry for collusion. It has been left to others to come up with a definition that can be used to weigh the actions, omissions and behaviour of security forces in a series of murders in which they have been accused of collusion. For some, a charge of collusion can only stick if there has been a secret agreement to deliberately and consciously plot to do something wrong. For others the definition would also cover having a mindset that means that officers were predisposed to behave or think in ways that meant some people were less protected than they should have been, that investigations were frustrated to protect agents and informers, regardless of their actions. The first official attempt at a definition was made by Sir John (now Lord) Stevens in 2003. Lord Stevens, the then Metropolitan Police Commissioner, carried out a major investigation into collusion in several murders. He said collusion ranges ""from the wilful failure to keep records, the absence of accountability, the withholding of intelligence and evidence, through to the extreme of agents being involved in murder."" Applying that definition to his three inquiries he reported: ""The co-ordination, dissemination and sharing of intelligence were poor. Informants and agents were allowed to operate without effective control and to participate in terrorist crimes. ""Nationalists were known to be targeted but were not properly warned or protected. Crucial information was withheld from senior investigating officers. Important evidence was neither exploited nor preserved."" In 2004, Canadian judge Peter Cory published six reports into alleged collusion in murders in Northern Ireland. In outlining his definition of collusion he highlighted several dictionary definitions of the word including ""to co-operate secretly: to have a secret understanding."" He added definitions of connive, a synonym of the verb collude, including this entry from the Oxford Compact Thesaurus: ""to deliberately ignore; to overlook; to disregard; to pass over; to take no notice of; to turn a blind eye; to wink; to excuse; to condone; to look the other way; to let something ride."" 'Connivance' From the Webster dictionary, he quoted: ""To pretend ignorance or unawareness of something one ought morally, or officially or legally to oppose; to fail to take action against a known wrongdoing or misbehaviour - usually used with connive at the violation of a law."" He went on to write: ""How should collusion be defined for the purposes of this inquiry?"" ""There cannot be public confidence in any government agency that is guilty of collusion or connivance with regard to serious crimes. Because of the necessity for public confidence in government agencies the definition of collusion must be reasonably broad when it is applied to such agencies. ""That is to say that they must not act collusively by ignoring or turning a blind eye to the wrongful acts of their servants or agents or by supplying information to assist those servants or agents in their wrongful acts or by encouraging others to commit a wrongful act."" An inquiry into the death of Billy Wright, in the Maze prison in 1997, took issue with the emphasis on connivance. ""It may be that the very wide definition of the word collusion that Judge Cory adopted was due to his concentration on one of the synonyms, namely the verb connive,"" the inquiry report said. ""We have been concerned throughout the inquiry by the width of the meaning applied by Judge Cory, having in mind in particular that the word is not to be found in our terms of reference. ""For our part we consider that the essence of collusion is an agreement or arrangement between individuals or organisations, including government departments, to achieve an unlawful or improper purpose. The purpose may also be fraudulent or underhand."" The first police ombudsman for Northern Ireland, Nuala (now Baroness) O'Loan adopted the definitions, in 2007, of Lord Stevens and Peter Cory to examine whether there had been collusion in the murder of Raymond McCord jnr. Using those definitions, she concluded that there had been collusion. Her successor as police ombudsman, Al Hutchinson, applied a less broad definition in his report on the attack, in 1971, on McGurk's Bar. In the report he wrote: ""The essence of collusion requires that a number of elements be present. Not only must there usually be an agreement between two or more parties, but there is also an additional requirement that a sufficiency of evidence exists to establish, on balance, that the act or omission complained of was deliberate and not merely negligent or inadvertent."" In his review of the murder of Pat Finucane, Sir Christopher de Silva said he had adopted a ""working definition"" of collusion less broad than that of Judge Cory and more in line with that of the Billy Wright inquiry panel. ""I do believe, as Judge Smithwick has said in relation to his Tribunal, that omissions by state agencies must be considered alongside positive acts when drawing a definition of collusion. ""It is, however, important to stress that, in order to fall within the ambit of collusion, such omissions must be classified as deliberate and not merely represent examples of incompetence or inefficiency. ""My own working definition, whilst not purporting to be definitive, is one I consider appropriate in relation to the allegations made and for the purposes of this particular case. ""I consider collusion to involve: (i) agreements, arrangements or actions intended to achieve unlawful, improper, fraudulent or underhand objectives; and (ii) deliberately turning a blind eye or deliberately ignoring improper or unlawful activity."" Irish judge Peter Smithwick gave a similar definition of collusion to that of Peter Cory. Smithwick, investigating allegations of Garda collusion in the murders of RUC officers Chief Supt Harry Breen and Supt Bob Buchanan, said: ""While (collusion) generally means the commission of an act, I am also of the view that it should be considered in terms of an omission or failure to act. ""In the active sense, collusion has amongst its meanings to conspire, connive or collaborate. ""In addition I intend to examine whether anybody deliberately ignored a matter, or turned a blind eye to it, or to have pretended ignorance or unawareness of something one ought morally, legally or officially oppose.""","The complex web of paramilitary gangs, security and intelligence forces, agents and informers, in Northern Ireland during the years of conflict were not a consideration for dictionary compilers when they wrote the entry for collusion.
